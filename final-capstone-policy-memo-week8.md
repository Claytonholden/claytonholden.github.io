# Final Capstone Policy Memo — Molson Coors Cyberattack (Week 8)

## Overview
This page links to my final project for CYBR2100: the **Capstone Policy Memo**.  
As the CIO of Molson Coors, I analyzed the March 2021 ransomware attack that shut down brewing and logistics for nearly two weeks.  
The memo combines an incident report, ethical and legal analysis, and a full Security & Operations Policy Framework with realistic clauses and timelines.

## Reflection
This course tied everything together — law, ethics, AI, bioethics, and real-world incident response.  
Writing this memo showed how technical failures, people, and policy all connect.  
The biggest takeaway was seeing how clear communication and well-defined authorization paths can stop a crisis from getting worse.  
I also learned how much small oversights like phishing awareness or vendor access can have massive consequences when they line up wrong.

## Acknowledgments
Thanks to Justin Holden and Austin at Molson Coors for taking time to share their experiences and insights about the 2021 incident.  
Their firsthand perspective helped me understand how the shutdown actually played out on the ground and how the recovery looked from inside the company.
