# Ethics & Law Orientation (Week 1)

## My Ethical Lens
The ethical framework that fits me best is Consequences (utilitarianism). I like this lens because it focuses on doing the most good and minimizing harm, which feels practical for real security work. At the same time, I know utilitarianism has flaws, so I also lean on Virtue and Care, since I try to act honestly and think about how my choices affect relationships and trust.  

## Authorization Principle
Authorization means having clear, documented permission from the system owner with defined scope, timeframe, and methods. For example, a student who wants to test a lab network tool must get written approval from IT Security or their instructor instead of relying on a friend’s or professor’s verbal okay.  

## Policy Snippet
Hocking College Lab Internet Acceptable Use Policy applies to everyone who uses the computers or network in Lab John Light 357. The lab is intended for school assignments, research, and approved projects only. To utilize the lab for any other than standard use, you need clear, written authorization.

Students should not run network scans, capture traffic, guess passwords, or any other security testing without written permission from IT. Downloading unapproved software, accessing files or accounts without permission, sharing or bypassing logins, or trying to disperse malicious code is prohibited.

By accessing the lab, you agree to limited monitoring, i.e., log in times, network traffic, or file access. Logs are kept for as short period (7 Days) for security purposes and only by authorized staff.

Any infractions should be reported to the IT Office. Breaking this policy could lead to loss of lab privileges, referral to Student Conduct, or legal action.

## Reflection
Looking back, I’d like to refine my policy snippet by making it even shorter and more user-friendly, since AUPs should be easy for students to understand quickly. Another area I could expand on is being more specific about data retention and appeals. The main stakeholders here are students, instructors, and IT staff. A clear policy protects students from crossing legal or ethical lines by mistake, while giving IT staff the authority and documentation they need to enforce rules fairly.
