# Ethics & Law Orientation (Week 1)

## My Ethical Lens
The ethical framework that fits me best is Consequences (utilitarianism). I like this lens because it focuses on doing the most good and minimizing harm, which feels practical for real security work. At the same time, I know utilitarianism has flaws, so I also lean on Virtue and Care, since I try to act honestly and think about how my choices affect relationships and trust.  

## Authorization Principle
Authorization means having clear, documented permission from the system owner with defined scope, timeframe, and methods. For example, a student who wants to test a lab network tool must get written approval from IT Security or their instructor instead of relying on a friend’s or professor’s verbal okay.  

## Policy Snippet
This policy applies to anyone using the computers or network in Lab John Light 357. The lab is here for schoolwork like class assignments, research, and instructor-approved projects. To do anything beyond normal use, you need clear, written authorization. Students are expected to keep their login credentials safe and only use the systems and resources they are assigned.  

Students may not run network scans, capture traffic, guess passwords, or do any other type of security testing unless it is part of a class assignment or approved in writing by IT. Installing unauthorized software, getting into accounts or files without permission, sharing or bypassing logins, or trying to spread harmful code is not allowed.  

Using the lab means you agree to limited monitoring, like logging login times, network activity, or file access. Logs are only kept as long as needed for security and can only be reviewed by authorized staff.  

Any violations should be reported to the IT Office. Breaking this policy can lead to losing lab access, being referred to Student Conduct, or facing disciplinary or legal action.

## Reflection
Looking back, I’d like to refine my policy snippet by making it even shorter and more user-friendly, since AUPs should be easy for students to understand quickly. Another area I could expand on is being more specific about data retention and appeals. The main stakeholders here are students, instructors, and IT staff. A clear policy protects students from crossing legal or ethical lines by mistake, while giving IT staff the authority and documentation they need to enforce rules fairly.
