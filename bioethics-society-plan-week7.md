# Bioethics & Society Plan (Week 7)

## Lab / Project Ethics Addendum (Final)
### Protocol Approval & Roles  
- The **faculty sponsor** must approve the project before it begins and is responsible for keeping it within campus policy and safety limits.  
- The **student team lead** organizes the setup, communicates with participants, and makes sure everyone follows the plan.  
- A **medical or safety staff member** must review any project that uses new or higher-risk devices and be available if needed.  

### Informed Consent  
- All participants receive a clear explanation of the study, what data will be collected, and any risks or benefits.  
- Joining is voluntary, and participants can quit anytime without penalty.  
- Consent forms explain simple examples of risks (like fatigue, mild discomfort, or data exposure) and possible benefits (learning experience, contribution to research).  

### Scope & Prohibitions  
- Only **non-invasive** wearables or brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) are allowed.  
- No one may test on themselves or others without direct supervision from the faculty sponsor.  
- No invasive, implantable, or unapproved prototype devices are permitted.  
- All testing must stay within approved lab or campus locations.  

### Data Handling  
- Collect only the **minimum data needed** for the study (sensor data, timestamps, and device readings).  
- Do not collect personal data unless absolutely required. If collected, separate it from other data and label it with an ID code instead of a name.  
- Store data on secure, password-protected drives and delete it after 30 days unless needed for course review.  
- Any identifying info will be **masked** before analysis or publication.  

### Incident & Withdrawal Process  
- Stop immediately if a participant reports pain, discomfort, device malfunction, or asks to withdraw.  
- The **faculty sponsor** must be notified within one hour if a safety or data incident occurs.  
- Withdrawn participants’ data is deleted within 24 hours of notice.  
- The student team lead documents all incidents and resolutions for review.

## Equity & Access Analysis  
Wearable and BCI technology can help people by improving accessibility, medical care, and research outcomes. However, it can also create inequality if only certain students or groups have access to the devices or if the data is used unfairly. To reduce inequity, all students should have the same opportunity to participate, and results should not favor one demographic or ability group. Making the devices available through campus labs and ensuring cost-free participation helps level the playing field.

## Justification  
This addendum follows the bioethics principles from **Chapter 12** of *Ethics in Technology*: **autonomy and consent** protect participants’ rights to make informed decisions; **beneficence and non-maleficence** keep the focus on doing good while preventing harm; and **justice** ensures fairness in who benefits and who bears the risks. **Chapter 13** reminds us that technology can improve lives but can also increase inequality if not managed responsibly. By setting limits, requiring informed consent, and keeping the data minimal and secure, this policy protects both participants and researchers while keeping the benefits of innovation open to everyone.

## Reflection  
If I revisited this project, I would spend more time defining clear **risk thresholds** for when a study needs extra medical review. I’d also tighten the consent process to make sure participants fully understand what’s being collected and how it’s used. Another trade-off is between access and safety—making the tech widely available is good for learning, but only if the right limits and supervision are in place.
