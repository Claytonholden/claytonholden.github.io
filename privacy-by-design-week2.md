# Privacy by Design: Monitoring Policy (Week 2)

## Principles Summary
Notice and consent means users should clearly know what data is collected and knowingly agree to it. Purpose limitation means data can only be used for the reason it was collected, not for anything else. Data minimization is collecting only the information needed to achieve the goal and nothing more. Proportionality means monitoring should match the actual risk, like tracking login attempts, but should not cross into invasive actions such as 24/7 screenshots or reading private messages.  

## My Monitoring & Retention Clause
Monitoring & Notice  
Hocking College monitors college computers, accounts, and networks to protect operations and keep systems reliable for students and staff. Monitoring is limited to authorized purposes such as system security, troubleshooting, and policy compliance. Users get notice through the Acceptable Use Policy, login banners, and lab postings. Personal communications are not reviewed unless required by law or as part of an active investigation. By using college systems, students and staff consent to this limited monitoring.  

Data Handling & Retention  
The college collects only the minimum data needed for security and support. Access to monitoring data is limited to trained IT staff, and records are normally retained for 30 days unless longer retention is required for an investigation or legal hold. After that, records are securely deleted. Individuals can raise concerns or appeal findings through the IT Office or the Student Conduct process. Violations may lead to loss of access, referral to Student Conduct, or disciplinary action under college policy.  

## Justification
This clause uses the principles of data minimization and proportionality to make sure monitoring protects systems without going overboard. It also includes notice and consent so users know what is being collected and why. These ideas connect to the ACM Code of Ethics section 1.6, “Respect privacy,” which says professionals have a duty to handle personal data carefully and only collect what is necessary.

## Reflection
If I refined this clause further, I would make the retention period even clearer and add more detail about the appeals process. I also think the language could be simplified so students understand it quickly. The stakeholders here are students, IT staff, and the college itself. A clear and balanced monitoring policy protects student trust while still giving IT staff what they need to keep systems safe.
