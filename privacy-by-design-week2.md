# Privacy by Design: Monitoring Policy (Week 2)

## Principles Summary
**Notice & consent** means users should clearly know what data is collected and knowingly agree to it.  
**Purpose limitation** means data can only be used for the reason it was collected, not anything else.  
**Data minimization** is about collecting only the smallest amount of information needed to achieve the goal.  
**Proportionality** means monitoring should match the actual risk—like tracking login attempts—but should not turn into constant surveillance such as 24/7 screenshots or reading private messages.

## My Monitoring & Retention Clause
**Monitoring & Notice**  
Hocking College monitors college computers, accounts, and networks to protect operations and keep systems reliable for students and staff. Monitoring is limited to authorized purposes such as system security, troubleshooting, and policy compliance. Users get notice through the Acceptable Use Policy, login banners, and lab postings. Personal communications are not reviewed unless required by law or as part of an active investigation. By using college systems, students and staff consent to this limited monitoring.  

**Data Handling & Retention**  
The college collects only the minimum data needed for security and support. Access to monitoring data is limited to trained IT staff, and records are normally retained for 30 days unless longer retention is required for an investigation or legal hold. After that, records are securely deleted. Individuals can raise concerns or appeal findings through the IT Office or the Student Conduct process. Violations may lead to loss of access, referral to Student Conduct, or disciplinary action as outlined in college policy. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Justification
This clause uses the principles of **data minimization** and **proportionality** to make sure monitoring protects systems without being excessive. It also provides **notice and consent** so users know what is being collected and why. These ideas connect directly to the **ACM Code of Ethics section 1.6, “Respect privacy,”** which calls on computing professionals to protect personal information and only collect what is necessary.

## Reflection
If I improved this clause further, I would make the **retention period** even clearer and maybe add more detail about the **appeals process** so students know exactly how to challenge a monitoring decision. I also think the language could be made a little simpler to reach students who don’t usually read policies. The stakeholders here are students, IT staff, and the college itself. A clear and fair monitoring policy builds trust with students while still protecting the systems IT is responsible for.
